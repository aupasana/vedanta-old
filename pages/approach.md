# The approach

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

The [main page](https://aupasana.com/vedanta) outlined the basic order of traditional study. 
A few addititional details are given here. 

### Sanskrit

A decent working knowledge of Sanskrit and it's grammar is necessary.
There are many different approaches to this -- both traditional and modern. Some study of
the mahakavyas, and grammatical texts such as the laghu siddhanta kaumudi is necessary.

### Vedanta prameya

With a basic grasp of Sanskrit, study some prakaranas which teach the main points of vedanta.
Study and memorize the tattva bodha. Optionally study additional texts such as vedanta sara.

### Shastra

Before studying the prasthana traya, study the basics of tarka, mimamsa and vedanta in a
structured way. 

1. Tarka -- Study tarka sangraha with the padakritya, and then again with the nyaya bodhini.
2. Mimamsa -- Study the artha sangraha and/or the mimamsa nyaya prakasha.
3. Vedanta (pramana) -- Study the vedanta paribhasha.
4. Vedanta (prameya) -- Study the siddhanta lesha sangraha.

### Prasthana Traya etc

Now the main study of the prasthāna traya with bhāṣhya begins, optionally with anandagiri's tika.
And this is followed by a study of the advanced vada granthas.
