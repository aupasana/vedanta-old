# tarka saṅgraha

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

tarka saṅgraha is the famous introductory text for tarka shāstra.
The mūla is first studied, and it is then studied again along
with the author's own commentary, the dīpikā. Since the dīpīkā
opens the door to the study of advanced texts such as the
celebrated gādhādharī, the dīpīkā is also known as the bāla gādhādharī.

The tarka saṅgraha can be divided into 4 sections:

1. प्रत्यक्ष परिच्छेदः
2. अनुमान परिच्छेदः
3. उपमान परिच्छेदः
4. शब्द परिच्छेदः

# nyāya siddhānta muktāvalī

The nyāya siddhānta muktāvalī is a commentary on the kārikāvalī (bhāṣhā pariccheda).
Together, they form a comprehensive text outlining the combined nyāya / vaiṣheśhika
scools. It is typically studied after the tarka saṅgraha.
