# vedānta siddhānta

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

Before starting a study of the prasthāna traya bhāṣhya, we first study
the siddhānta through two texts -- the vedānta paribhāṣhā and siddhānta lesha saṅgraha.
These texts require knowledge of tarka and mīmāmsā, which are the pre-requisites.

## vedānta paribhāṣhā

The vedānta paribhāṣhā discusses each of the six pramāṇas accepted by vedānta. It then
discusses the viṣhaya and phala as well. This text requires a good grounding in
navya nyāya.

Swami madhavananda writes that 'the vedānta paribhāṣhā is the most widely read book
on [vedānta] philosophy next to sadananda yogindra's vedanta sara'.

## siddhānta lesha saṅgraha

The siddhānta lesha saṅgraha is a comprehensive text by Appayya Dikshita which summarizes
the entire advaita siddhānta, including all the different explanations by later āchāryas.
This includes the positions of the bhāmatī and vivaraṇa scools.
