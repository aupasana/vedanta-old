# other

The [kailash ashram's][ka] recordings of their traditional Hindi classes
are available for purchase if you contact them directly. This includes
the A-Z of vedānta and related darshanas, as well as advanced vāda granthas.
Perhaps the only teaching that is 'missing' is the siddhānta lesha saṅgraha.
